## Description

Landmarks and historical sites are some of the most frequently photographed places on Earth. Yet, each shot has a slightly different angle and shadows vary on times of day or year. One photo could be taken from the ground, another up some steps, and a third from a drone. Matching many images across different viewpoints is a fundamental Computer Vision problem that is far from solved. Factors like surface texture or surroundings can cause an otherwise well-performing algorithm to degrade.

The process of reconstructing a 3D model of an environment from a collection of images is called Structure from Motion (SfM). These images are often captured by trained operators or with additional sensor data. This ensures homogeneous, high-quality data. It’s much more difficult to build 3D models from assorted images, the real-world examples we’ve put together for this competition. In fact, we’ve designated 6 categories, each with its distinct challenge:

Phototourism and historical preservation: different viewpoints, sensor types, time of day/year, and occlusions. Ancient historical sites add a unique set of challenges

Night vs day and temporal changes: combination of day and night photographs, including poor lighting, or photographs taken months or years apart, in different weather

Aerial and mixed aerial-ground: images from drones, featuring arbitrary in-plane rotations, matched against similar images and also images taken from the ground

Repeated structures: symmetrical objects require details to disambiguate perspective

Natural environments: highly non-regular structures such as trees and foliage

Transparencies and reflections: objects like glassware are lacking in texture and create reflections and specularities which pose a different set of problems

Your efforts could contribute to a better understanding of this fundamental problem in Computer Vision. We hope to encourage knowledge sharing between traditional image-matching techniques and cutting-edge machine learning by including many categories.
