# SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D
#### Segment vasculature in 3D scans of human kidney


## Link

### Overview
The goal of this competition is to segment blood vessels. You will create a model trained on 3D Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) data from human kidneys to help complete a picture of vasculature throughout a body.

Your work will better researchers' understanding of the size, shape, branching angles, and patterning of blood vessels in human tissue.
