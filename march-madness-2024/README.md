## March Machine Learning Mania 2024

Another year, another chance to predict the upsets, call the probabilities, and put your bracketology skills to the leaderboard test. In our tenth annual March Machine Learning Mania competition, Kagglers will once again join the millions of fans who attempt to predict the outcomes of this year's college basketball tournaments. Unlike most fans, you will pick the winners and losers using a combination of rich historical data and computing power, while the ground truth unfolds on television.

You are provided data of historical NCAA games to forecast the outcomes of the Division 1 Men's and Women's basketball tournaments. This competition is the official 2024 edition, with points, medals, prizes, and basketball glory at stake.

We have made an update to the competition format this year. You will be making bracket predictions for both tournaments, similar to traditional tournament contests, but you will be allowed to submit an entire portfolio of brackets, anywhere from 1 to 100,000.
