### Overview
In this competition, you’ll develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific protein targets – a critical step in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry that would pave the way for more accurate drug discovery. You’ll help predict which drug-like small molecules (chemicals) will bind to three possible protein targets.

### Description
Small molecule drugs are chemicals that interact with cellular protein machinery and affect the functions of this machinery in some way. Often, drugs are meant to inhibit the activity of single protein targets, and those targets are thought to be involved in a disease process. A classic approach to identify such candidate molecules is to physically make them, one by one, and then expose them to the protein target of interest and test if the two interact. This can be a fairly laborious and time-intensive process.
